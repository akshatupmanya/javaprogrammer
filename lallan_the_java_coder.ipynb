            "simpliﬁed f orm. In practice, most uses of enums will only need the simpliﬁed\n",
            "form that is presented her e.\n",
            "2.3. OBJECTS AND SUBROUTINES 35 An enum is a type that has a ﬁxed list of\n",

            "enum is similar to the boolean data type, which has trueand false as its only\n",

            "types, the com puter will convert one of the values from one type to another.\n",
            "For example, to compute 37.4 + 10, the computer will convert the integer 10 to a\n",
            "real number 10.0 and will then compute 37.4 + 10.0. This is called a type\n",

            "divide two integers, the answer will always be an integer; if the quotient has a\n",
            "fractional pa rt, it is discarded. For example, the value of7/2is3, not3.5.\n",
            "IfNis an integer variable, then N/100 is an integer, and 1/Nis equal to zero for\n",

            "for negative operands, %is not quite the same as the usual mathematical\n",
            "“modulus” operator, since if one of AorBis negative, then the value ofA % B will\n",
            "be negative.) For example, 7 % 2 is1, while34577 % 100 is77, and50 % 8 is 2. A\n",

            "an integer Nis evenly divisible by an integer Mby checking whether N % M is\n",
            "zero. Finally, you might need the unary minus operator, which takes the negative\n",
            "of a number.\n",
            "46 CHAPTER 2. NAMES AND THINGS For example, -Xhas the same value as (-1)*X . For\n",
            "completeness, Java also has a unary plus operator, as in +X, even though it\n",

            "ﬁnal note in this section, I will mention one more type of s tatement in Java:\n",
            "the empty statement . This is a statement that consists simply of a semicolon\n",
            "and w hich tells the computer to do nothing. The existence of the empty\n",
            "statement makes the following legal, even though you would not ordinarily see a\n",
            "semicolon after a }: if (x < 0) { x = -x; }; The semicolon is legal after the },\n",
            "but the computer considers it to be an empty statement, not part of the\n",
            "ifstatement. Occasionally, you might ﬁnd yourself using the e mpty statement\n",
            "when what you mean is, in fact, “do nothing”. For example, the rather contrived\n",
            "ifstatement if ( done ) ; // Empty statement else System.out.println( \"Not done\n",
            "yet. ); does nothing when the boolean variabledone is true, and prints out “Not\n",
            "done yet” when it is false. You can’t just leave out the semicolon in this exa\n",
            "mple, since Java syntax requires an actual statement between the ifand theelse.\n",
            "I prefer, though, to use an empty block, consisting of {and}with nothing\n",
            "between, for such cases. Occasionally, stray empty statements can cause\n",
            "annoying, h ard-to-ﬁnd errors in a program. For example, the following program\n",
            "segment prints out “Hell o” just once, not ten times: for (int i = 0; i < 10;\n",
            "i++); System.out.println(\"Hello\");\n",
            "96 CHAPTER 3. CONTROL Why? Because the “;” at the end of the ﬁrst line is a\n",
            "statement, and it is this statement that is executed ten times. The\n",
            "System.out.println statement is not really inside the for statement at all, so\n",
            "it is executed just once, after the forloop has completed. 3.6 The switch\n",
            "Statement The second branching statement in Java is the switch statement, which\n",
            "is introduced in this section. The switch statement is used far less often than\n",
            "the ifstatement, but it is sometimes useful for expressing a certain type of\n",
            "multi-way branch. 3.6.1 The Basic switch Statement A switch statement allows you\n",
            "to test the value of an expressi on and, depending on that value, to jump\n",
            "directly to some location within the switch statemen t. Only expressions of\n",
            "certain types can be used. The value of the expression can be one of the\n",
            "primitive integer types int, short, orbyte. It can be the primitive chartype.\n",
            "Or, as we will see later in this section, it can be an enumuerated type. In\n",
            "particular, the expression cannot be aString or a real number. The positions\n",
            "that you can jump to are marked with case labels that take the form: “case\n",
            "/angbracketleftconstant /angbracketright:”. This marks the position the computer\n",
            "jumps to when the exp ression evaluates to the given /angbracketleftconstant\n",
            "/angbracketright. As the ﬁnal case in a switch statement you can, optionally,\n",
            "use the label “default:”, which provides a default jump poin t that is used when\n",
            "the value of the expression is not listed in any case label. Aswitch statement,\n",
            "as it is most oftern used, has the form: switch ( /angbracketleftexpression\n",
            "/angbracketright) { case /angbracketleftconstant-1 /angbracketright:\n",
            "/angbracketleftstatements-1 /angbracketright break; case\n",
            "/angbracketleftconstant-2 /angbracketright: /angbracketleftstatements-2\n",
            "/angbracketright break; . . // (more cases) . case /angbracketleftconstant-N\n",
            "/angbracketright: /angbracketleftstatements-N /angbracketright break; default:\n",
            "// optional default case /angbracketleftstatements-(N+1) /angbracketright } //\n",
            "end of switch statement Thebreak statements are technically optional. The eﬀect\n",
            "of a break is to make the computer jump to the end of the switch statement. If\n",
            "you leave out the br eak statement, the computer will just forge ahead after\n",
            "completing one case and will exec ute the statements associated with the next\n",
            "case label. This is rarely what you want, but it is leg al. (I will note\n",
            "here—although you won’t understand it until you get to the next chapter—tha t\n",
            "inside a subroutine, the break statement is sometimes replaced by a return\n",
            "statement.) Note that you can leave out one of the groups of statements ent\n",
            "irely (including the break ). You then have two case labels in a row, containing\n",
            "two diﬀeren t constants. This just means\n",
            "3.6. THE SWITCH STATEMENT 97 that the computer will jump to the same place and\n",
            "perform the s ame action for each of the two constants. Here is an example of a\n",
            "switch statement. This is not a useful e xample, but it should be easy for you\n",
            "to follow. Note, by the way, that the constants in the case labels don’t have to\n",
            "be in any particular order, as long as they are all diﬀerent: switch ( N ) { //\n",
            "(Assume N is an integer variable.) case 1: System.out.println(\"The number is\n",

            "8.\"); System.out.println(\"(That’s a power of 2!)\"); break; case 3: case 6: case\n",
            "9: System.out.println(\"The number is 3, 6, or 9.\"); System.out.println(\"(That’s\n",

            "break; default: System.out.println(\"The number is 7 or is outside the range 1 to\n",
            "9.\"); } The switch statement is pretty primitive as control structu res go, and\n",
            "it’s easy to make mis- takes when you use it. Java takes all its control\n",
            "structures d irectly from the older programming languages C and C++. The switch\n",
            "statement is certainly one pl ace where the designers of Java should have\n",
            "introduced some improvements. 3.6.2 Menus and switch Statements One application\n",
            "of switch statements is in processing menus. A menu is a list of options . The\n",
            "user selects one of the options. The computer has to respo nd to each possible\n",
            "choice in a diﬀerent way. If the options are numbered 1, 2, ... , then the n\n",
            "umber of the chosen option can be used in a switch statement to select the\n",
            "proper response. In aTextIO -based program, the menu can be presented as a\n",
            "numbered list o f options, and the user can choose an option by typing in its\n",
